# Demo
At this moment there is only one [live demo](https://rudyorre.github.io/TensorFaux-Demo) of this package, which utilizes [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/) to run the source code locally in the browser. The demo code is the same as what's shown on the [home screen](https://rudyorre.github.io/TensorFaux), but it can be edited to run anything within Numpy and Tensorfaux.
